## What did I experience?

## What did I do?

I worked on creating a school news app.

## What happened?

This part of your work will cover the question “what?”. You want to provide a clear picture of what you did at your placement and communicate it. 

You can approach this as presenting a “snapshot” of your placement; your tasks during a typical day and/or how your role changed over the course of the semester.

## Tutorials 

How to read errors
How to add a new feature
How to break down a UI

## Snapshot

- Getting started
  - reading the code
    - how the code is structured
    - what the different parts do
  - running the app
  - will take a good amount of time, might feel overwhelming
- finding problems
  - running the app for unexpected behaviour
  - the preview image is not loading
- finding solutions
  - determining why the problem is occurring
    - does the image not exist?

  - determining where the problem is located
    - the image exists, the internet is fine, the interface is not loading
    - add blog screen > image widget
      - finding the specific lines of code
  - research and implement the solution
    - often other people will have the same issue
    - the issue is that the interface has to be told when the image gets uploaded
